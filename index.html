               <h2>Proposal Park</h2>
               <p> 
                  This was taken at a park near my house where my wife and I would go to walk around the 
                  lake while she was here. In 2018 when she came back for another visit I proposed to at the same 
                  spot they were was taken.

               <p> 
                  These were taken at a place called Danedenong Beach. I have a video of a seagull trying to eat a fish the same size as it. I was trying to embed
                  it but I couldnt get it to work properly.

               <h2>Otway National Park</h2>
               <p>
                  These taken on the way to the Great Ocean Road. It was a national park where you have to climb down a bunch of really old steps to get to the bottom of a waterfall!

               <p>This is the only landscape picture of the waterfall. I don't know why I took all my waterfall pictures vertically.

               <h2>Great Ocean Road</h2>
               <p>
                  These are of the Great Ocean Road. It's a really cool drive, it's super windy and bendy with the cliffs and ocean on one side and a beautiful forest on the other.
                  The rocks in the pictures are called <em>"The 12 apostles"</em>. I think there are only 9 left due to the ocean slowly destorying them.
                  I have some videos of the drive but, once again, I couldn't get them to embed properly.

               <p>
                  Just some pictures of my Emma and I on our way to a war memorial in the heart of the city. It's really cool inside and you can get to the top. They light these pretty cool fires every night too.
